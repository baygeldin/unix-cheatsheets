# Unix Cheatsheets

Here I store some of my cheatsheets that can be useful when doing things with unix (e.g. cheatsheet for bash, vim, etc.). I'm trying to keep it precise and essential, so that information will remain minimal, but sufficient. I update cheatsheets anytime I find something that seems useful to me, so they're forever in progress. That's it! (─‿─)

P.S.: There are a lot of cheatsheets for this and that already, but I believe that the best cheatsheet - is your own cheatsheet, 'cause you can adjust it to yourself and anytime you forgot something you know where to find it. Though I'll be happy if it'll be helpful for someone. （＾_＾）
